Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenADK tries to detect what part of the system should be rebuilt when the
system configuration is changed through +make menuconfig+.  In some cases it
automatically rebuilt packages, but sometimes just a warning is printed to the
terminal, that a rebuild is necessary to make the changes an effect. If strange
things are happening, the autodetection might have not worked correctly, then
you should consider to rebuild everything. If you are following development you
should always do a full rebuild after fetching updates via +git pull+. It is
not always required, but if anything fails, you are on your own.
Use following to do a full rebuild without refetching distfiles:

--------------------
 $ make cleandir && make
--------------------

Understanding how to rebuild packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In OpenADK you can rebuild a single package with:
--------------------
 $ make package=<pkgname> clean package
--------------------

It will automatically remove all files added to the staging target directory
+target_*+. If you just want to restart compilation process, after making
some fixes in +build_*/w-<pkgname>-<pkgversion>/+, just do:
--------------------
 $ make package=<pkgname> package
--------------------

If you are happy with your changes to the package sources, you can automatically
generate a patch, which will be saved in +package/<pkgname>/patches+ and automatically
applied on the next clean rebuild:
--------------------
 $ make package=<pkgname> update-patches
--------------------

The newly created patches will be opened in $EDITOR, so you can add some comments to
the top of the file, before the diff.


Offline builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you intend to do an offline build and just want to download
all sources that you previously selected in the configurator
then issue:

--------------------
 $ make download
--------------------

You can now disconnect or copy the content of your +dl+
directory to the build-host.

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenADK also honors some environment variables, when they are passed
to +make+. The most useful and common ones are:

* +ADK_APPLIANCE+, the appliance task you want to build
* +ADK_CUSTOM_TASKS_DIR+, extra directory to fetch tasks from
* +ADK_TARGET_OS+, the operating system of the target system
* +ADK_TARGET_ARCH+, the architecture of the target system
* +ADK_TARGET_CPU+, the specific CPU optimization for the target system (f.e. cortex-a53)
* +ADK_TARGET_SYSTEM+, the embedded target system name
* +ADK_TARGET_LIBC+, the C library for the target system
* +ADK_TARGET_ABI+, the ABI for the target system (f.e. MIPS N64)
* +ADK_TARGET_ENDIAN+, the endianess for the target system (little/big)
* +ADK_TARGET_BINFMT+, the binary format for the target system (f.e. ELF/FLAT/FDPIC)
* +ADK_TARGET_FLOAT+, the float support for the target system (f.e. soft/softfp/hard)
* +ADK_TARGET_FS+, the firmware type or root filesystem for the target system
* +ADK_VERBOSE+, verbose build, when set to 1


An example that creates a configuration file for Raspberry PI with all
software packages enabled, but not included in the resulting firmware image:

--------------------
 $ make ADK_APPLIANCE=new ADK_TARGET_ARCH=arm ADK_TARGET_SYSTEM=raspberry-pi ADK_TARGET_LIBC=musl allmodconfig
--------------------

This is often used in the development process of a target system, to verify that
all packages are compilable.
